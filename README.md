# iSpawners

Virtual spawners that automatically store mob drops in a GUI<br>
<br>
If you see any references to ESpawners, it's because that was what the project was originally named until I found out there was previously a spawner plugin with that name.<br>
<br>
Commands: <br>
/iSpawners <br>
/iSpawners about <br>
/iSpawners setspawnerstack <amount> <br>
